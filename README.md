# A-Star-Pathfinding made using Processing.

This is an example of how A* Pathfinding works. I used
some online resources to figure out how the algorithm
works and then translated the knowledge over to Processing.
I wanted to challenge myself with the programming and chose
to use Processing as it is a tool I haven't used in a long time.
